# Automated Canisters Reloaded

Automated canisters, rewritten for the latest game version.<br>

This mod lets auto sweepers pick up gases and liquids, which can now be used in a conveyor loader.<br>
Also adds 4 new buildings to help convert between canisters and pipes.

Helpful for automating buildings such as the super computer or the molecular forge.

## Buildings

 - Conveyor Gas Loader: loads gases from a pipe onto a conveyor rail.
 - Conveyor Liquid Loader: loads liquids from a pipe onto a conveyor rail.
 - Conveyor Gas Unloader: unloads canisters from a conveyor rail into a gas pipe.
 - Conveyor Liquid Unloader: unloads bottles from a conveyor rail into a liquid pipe.
